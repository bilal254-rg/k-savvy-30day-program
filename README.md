# [K-Savvy🔥@Ubuntu] — 30-Day Checklist

I learn to defend people from scams and cybercrime.  
My goal is to build skills in Linux, networking, Python, web security, and forensics — always legally and ethically — so I can help victims, harden systems, and work with authorities when needed.

This repository contains notes, scripts, and learning progress for the 30-day defender program starting Nov 8, 2025.

- Owner: K-Savvy  
- Start date: 2025-11-08  
- Motto: No revenge. Only legal defensive work.
